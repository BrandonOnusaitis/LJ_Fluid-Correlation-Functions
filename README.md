# LJ_Fluid-Correlation-Functions

This repo contains a LJ fluid that was simulated to reproduce a Figure in M.P. Allen & D.J. Tildesley's book "Computer Simulation of Liquids" 2nd Edition, on page 284 figure A. This contains the normalized time correlation function of the kinetic temperature. Data for this figure was generated by running a simple lammps simulation under approximately the same thermodynamic constraints (N,V,T).
